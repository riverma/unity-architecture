| ADES | *See Application deployment and Execution Service* | |
| Algorithm | A conceptual set of steps or methods refining data into information | |
| API | *See Application Programming Interface* | |
| Application | The implementation of an algorithm via software. | |
| Application Deployment and Execution Service (ADES) | TBD | |
| Application Package | TBD | |
| Application Programming Interface (API) | TBD | |
| Archive | Long term storage location for data and related products, such as the algorithms and software used to generate them. NASA Archives include DAACs and PDS Nodes | |
| Authentication | TBD | |
| Authorization | TBD | |
| Budget | TBD | |

| High Performance Computing environment| TBD | |
| HPC | *See High Performance Computing environment* | |
| Job | Combination of tasks that defines a transactional unit for the engine. The job succeeds if all tasks succeed. The job fails if any task fails. Always executed on the same worker node. | |
| PDS | *see Planetary Data System*||
| Pipeline | Combination of workflows that are chained together by rules or triggers. Different workflows are started at different times. Logical concept rather than a defined construct supported by the engine.| |
| Planetary Data System (PDS) | TBD | |
| Project | TBD | |
| Provenance | TBD | |
| Task | Atomic set of operations (one or more) that cannot be further decomposed by the engine. Always run as a whole. | |
| Tenant | TBD | |
| Transform | TBD | |
| UI | *See User Interface* | |
| User Interface | TBD | |
| User Experience | TBD | |
| UX |  *See User Experience* | |
| Venue | TBD | |
| Workflow | Combination of jobs and/or tasks that are defined to be executed together. Scheduled or triggered by a single event or request. Has a single start time. Information may be shared across jobs/tasks in the workflow. | |
