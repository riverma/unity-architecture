| Job | Combination of tasks that defines a transactional unit for the engine. The job succeeds if all tasks succeed. The job fails if any task fails. Always executed on the same worker node. | |
| PDS | *see Planetary Data System*||
| Pipeline | Combination of workflows that are chained together by rules or triggers. Different workflows are started at different times. Logical concept rather than a defined construct supported by the engine.| |
| Planetary Data System (PDS) | TBD | |
| Project | TBD | |
| Provenance | TBD | |
| Task | Atomic set of operations (one or more) that cannot be further decomposed by the engine. Always run as a whole. | |
