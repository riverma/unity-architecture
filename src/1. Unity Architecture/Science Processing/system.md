# Science Processing Services

The Science Processing Service (SPS) system is responsible for deployment and execution of algorithms to create new data products. The SPS leverages OGC WPS-T standards for the deployment, request, and status of data production requests.

**Execution Management Service (EMS)** - Transactional service for deploying workflows, requesting/monitoring/stopping workflow execution, and quoting processing cost estimates.
